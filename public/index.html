              The UEFA Champions League Anthem, officially titled simply
              "Champions League", is the official anthem of the UEFA Men's
              Champions League, written by English composer Tony Britten in
              1992, and based on George Frideric Handel's Zadok the Priest. It
              was also the official anthem of the UEFA Women's Champions League
              from its creation in 2001 to the 2021 creation of an independent
              anthem. The complete anthem is about three minutes long, and has
              two short verses and the chorus. The lyrics are in UEFA's three
              official languages: English, French, and German.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p class="text-justify">
              The chorus is set to the exclamations "Die Meister! Die Besten!
              Les grandes équipes! The champions!". The anthem is played inside
              the stadium before the start of each UEFA Champions League match,
              in addition to the beginning and end of television broadcasts of
              the games. Special vocal versions of the anthem have been
              performed live at the UEFA Champions League Final. UEFA's official
              website states, "the anthem is now almost as iconic as the
              trophy."

              The European Champion Clubs' Cup, also known as the European Cup, is a trophy awarded annually by UEFA to the football club that wins the UEFA Champions League. In its former form, the competition bore the same name as the Cup and was also known as the European Cup before being renamed from the 1992/93 season. Several physical trophies bore this name, as a club was allowed to keep the trophy after five wins or three consecutive victories and a new trophy had to be forged for the following season. The original European Cup trophy was donated by the French sports newspaper L'Équipe. In March 1967, this trophy was permanently awarded to Real Madrid. At that time, Real Madrid was the reigning champion and had won a total of six titles, including the first five competitions from 1956 to 1960, making Celtic the first club to win the trophy in its current form in 1967.
